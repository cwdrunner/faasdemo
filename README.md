# faasdemo
This is one of the home lab projects. Initially this README contains a general description and some of the issues encountered so they can be avoided next time. 

## architecture
The home lab consists of the following components:

- 4 Raspbery Pi 4b with 4Gb Ram. Arm CPU. 32 Gb micro SD cards. POE Hats, This group acts as the K3s cluster
- 2 4 port POE Gb unmanaged routers. Obviously and 8 or 16 port router would be better but the lab evolved.
- A spare HP laptop. AMD CPU. The laptop became a major controller as a lot of things wouldn't run on ARM and so it was easier to move forward. 
Future projects could push the technology out. 
- Misc other Pis for NAS, Home Automation, monitoring the aquarium.
